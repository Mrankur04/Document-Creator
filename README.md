HOW TO deploy on GitHub Pages (quick):

2. Upload all files and folders from this package to the repository root.
3. In repo: Settings → Pages → Branch: main, Folder: / (root) → Save.

Notes:
- jsPDF and pdf-lib are loaded from CDN in the files where required.
- Client-side PDF merging and image→PDF work in the browser (no server).
- PDF compression is limited in-browser; for best compression use server-side tools or third-party services.
- Replace 'support@example.com' in contact.html with your real email.
